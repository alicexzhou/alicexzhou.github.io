										<h2>Premise</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In the United States, the most common mode of death in pediatric ICUs is withdrawal of life support. This removal of life support is frequently the removal of ventilator support, also known as terminal extubation. </p>
									<p>Doctors and families are often faced with questions regarding the end-of-life process including how long it takes for their child to pass away after terminal extubation. Knowing this information is valuable for family care, and if the family wishes, to identify potential candidates for organ donation. We partnered with palliative clinicians to train machine learning models to predict time to death after terminal extubation.
									This multi-institutional project resulted in a web application that used the created model.</p>

												<h3>DONATE Web Application - Made with Flask (HTML, CSS, Python)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I helped create the DONATE web application. This tool predicts the probability of death within 1 hour after terminal extubation. It allows a clinician to input information about the patient and highlights high-impact variables that increase or decrease this probability.</p>

											<span>One hour was chosen because: </span>
												<ol>
													<li>It best facilitates family planning. More deaths happen within 1 hour than not, and the tool allows family to know if they have some time or if they should call other family members to the bedside.<br>
													<li>Patients who die within one hour are eligible for organ donation, wheras those who die later are typically not. One hour is the ischemic time recommended by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). It is also the most common time period institutions use if they practice organ donation after circulatory death.
